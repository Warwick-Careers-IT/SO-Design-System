<h4>Developer Friendly Prototyping Kit</h4>

<p>You can download this codebase and run it locally. This is useful for prototyping and contributing to the design system. </p>

<p>While maintaining Warwick ID7 codebase, the kit frees you from Sitebuilder while you build your website design system / prototype</p>

<section class="boxstyle_ box1">
<ul>

<li>GIT based codebase for team base development.</li>
<li>Gulp Cli build tools.</li>
<li>GIT based Branch deployment to Netlify/Heroku for rapid prototyping and A/B testing</li>
