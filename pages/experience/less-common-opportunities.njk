<h2>Work shadowing</h2>

<p>Work shadowing involves spending a brief periods (from a few
hours to a few days) observing someone at work and learning more about an
occupation or a sector, but does not include actually undertaking work.<p>

<ul>
 <li>Supports
     self-awareness and informs your career planning decisions </li>
 <li>Unpaid</li>
 <li>Helps you
     understand more about job roles and build your network of contacts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Insight programmes and spring weeks</h2>

<p>Insight programmes are primarily designed for first
year undergraduate students to learn about the organisation.&nbsp; You will engage in a range of activities
including workshops, presentations and site tours.<p>

<ul>
 <li>Often used by
     employers as a way of finding talented students </li>
 <li>Unpaid</li>
 <li>Completing an
     insight programme may help you secure an internship or placement later on,
     and give you unique in-depth insight into an organisation and sector.</li></ul>

<h2>Mentoring</h2>

<p>Mentors offer student support and practical advice to other
students</p>

<p>This may be academic or
personal support on a one-to-one or group basis, either as a stand-alone
session, or as part of a longer mentoring process.</p>

<p>Sharing your insights to improve other students’ confidence,
knowledge or performance also contributes to your own personal development and
self-awareness.</p>

<p>Competitions may focus on a particular technical
skill, or test your business acumen but learning how to present a perfect pitch
or promote your particular skills will always be a valuable experience whatever
your future career plans.</p>
<ul>

     always be monetary in value, but may include business mentoring, travel
     costs to an international event or promotional activity, and worth so much
     more</li>

     your tenacity, creativity, and resilience as well as your ability to
     perform under pressure</li>

the University’s capacity to contribute research or expertise.<p>

require mutual planning and commitment to get the best result.</p>

activities of the University</li>
