<h1 class="guide-page-title">Commitments and costs</h1>


<h2>What is your commitment as a WSI Intern? </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Take part in your internship for a minimum of 6 weeks without taking leave.</li>
  <li>Take part in learning activities designed to enhance your internship.</li>
  <li>Confirm or complete the appropriate salary payment process.</li>
  <li>Complete an end of programme evaluation form supplied by Warwick.</li>
  <li>Enter into an agreement with the University that sets out the expectations of all three parties - you, your host organisation/ department, and the University of Warwick. This ensures that you enter into the internship with a clear understanding of your own responsibilities to your host employer/ department and the University, the responsibilities of the host employer/ department towards you and the University, and our responsibilities to you and the host employer/ department, all of which underpin our grant model, a successful learning experience and a value-added experience for you.</li>
  <li>Commit to working as an employee of the host organisation. As an intern, you will be given the appropriate supervision to acknowledge that this is a learning experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What will a WSI internship cost you?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Accommodation and travel (including interview travel)</li>
  <li>You may need to pay upfront for accommodation and travel expenses before you receive your first pay check which tends to be at the end of your first working month.</li>
  <li>Lunches</li>
  <li>Suitable clothing</li>
  <li>Remember you will take home less than the advertised rate as most salaried earnings are subject to deductions for Income Tax and National Insurance. For more information, please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">GOV.UK</a> website.</li>
</ul>
