{% block main_content %}

<p>Having some experience of work before you leave university has many benefits, more than you might first think. Not only can it help you gain genuine examples and evidence to support future applications and interviews, it can also help you make important decisions about what you do and donâ€™t enjoy and what career you want to pursue.</p>

<p>Anything that allows you to develop professional skills can be a form of work experience, so there are many different possibilities to suit different needs. </p>
