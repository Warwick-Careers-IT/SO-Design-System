<h2>What we expect from you</h2>

  <li>Honour any commitments that you have made with us; turn up on time for the start of events or workshops you have signed up to. Failure to attend two events or appointments will result in temporary withdrawal of bookable services for 4 weeks</li>

  <li>Have a realistic view of what we can discuss with you during the time available during the 30 minutes. If you arrive late then your appointment will be shortened accordingly</li>
