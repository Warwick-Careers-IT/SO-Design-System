# Publishing on the web (Heroku)

We are using [Netify](http://www.heroku.com) the prototype online. Itâ€™s simple and fast to deploy new versions as you work.

Once your prototype is on Netify, other people will be able to access and try your prototype from their own computers or mobile devices.

> **DO NOT** enter real user data in to prototypes hosted on Netify. If your prototype stores or collects user data, talk to a security professional about appropriate security steps you must take.
