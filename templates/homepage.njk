                  self-catering undergraduate halls of residence on campus. Our own student property management and
                  lettings agency manages more than 8,000 rooms both on and off campus, and provides advice to all
                  full-time undergraduates.</p>

                <p>You won't be short of ways to spend your time on campus - whether it's visiting the award-winning
                  Warwick Arts Centre, using our many sports facilities, socialising in our bars and cafés, or
                  enjoying an open-air event. But there are peaceful spots too, with lakes, woodland and green spaces
                  just a few minutes’ walk from central campus.</p>

                  gaming or musical theatre, you can instantly connect with people with similar interests. Or you
                  could try something new – Bhangra dancing or circus skills anyone?</p>
