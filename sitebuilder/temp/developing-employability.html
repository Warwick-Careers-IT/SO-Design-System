  <h1>Developing employability during the experience</h1>


<p>You will get the most out of your work experience if you really understand what it is you want to gain or develop and plan how you are going to do that. Even if the experience did not turn out as expected, for example, you realised that you do not like working in the finance sector, you will still find out what you do not want to do and cross that option off the list.</p>


<h2>Research into the organisation</h2>

<p>Research into the organisation will not only impress your employer and develop your commercial awareness, but also help you to learn about the job quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the organisation about? Mission? Culture? Offering e.g. products or services?</li>
  <li>What is the general state of the market in which it operates?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employability Skills</h2>

<p>Having a clear idea of your likes and dislikes, values, and skills which you possess and lack, can make exploring your career options and decisions a much more manageable process.</p>

<p>It’s importance to match your skills and experience to the expectations of recruiters. It will also enable you to make a more informed decision about what you want to achieve from the work experience.   Think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where am I now?</li>
  <li>Where do I want to be?</li>
  <li>How do I get there?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting objectives</h2>

<p>Setting clear objectives at the start of your work experience will maximise your learning experience and retain a focus on your work experience objectives, and your personal and long term career goals. It will enable you to plug skills gaps and fine tune the skills and experiences which will help to increase your employability towards long term career goals.</p>

<p>Discuss with your line manager on how to use your strengths while developing your weaker areas, to facilitate your personal development alongside your skills during your work experience. </p>

<h2>What is expected of you in the professional workplace. </h2>

<p>Acting professionally in a work environment is vital in order to uphold your organisation’s standards and brand and avoid potential embarrassment. It’s also your key to gaining the respect and support of your colleagues, with the sense of understanding and belonging that these bring. </p>

<h3>Ways of being professional at work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reliability. People can depend on you to show up, and submit work, on time.</li>
<li>Honesty. You tell the truth and are upfront about where things stand. Careful not to be outspoken or rude, and make sure you’re ready for any repercussions if offering criticism.</li>
<li>Respect for Others. You treat everyone as if they matter. Grasping the preferred level of formality when speaking to your managers is a quick win.</li>
<li>	Being Positive. Avoid pessimism. Having an upbeat attitude and trying to be a problem-solver makes a big difference.</li>
<li>Listening Carefully. You check understanding and give people a chance to be heard.</li>
</ul>
