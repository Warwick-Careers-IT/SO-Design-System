  <h1>Understanding your Rights at Work</h1>


<h3>Your Right to Work in the UK</h3>

<p>Every organisation in the UK has to check that their workers have the right to work here, in the UK. If you are on Tier 4 or any other visas, you are likely to be bound by working restrictions.  Your visa and relevant documents should give you this information.  See the links section for more information.</p>


<h3>Employment Status</h3>

<p>A person’s employment status helps determine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their rights</li>
  <li>their employer’s responsibilities</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing your employment status will help you to establish your rights, and expectations of your role.  Depending on your employment status, you can be classed as:</p>

<ul>
<li>a worker </li>
<li>a volunteer or</li>
<li>an employee </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are expected to work at specific times and doing work that would normally be undertaken in the organisation then, you are likely to be considered a worker.  As a worker, you are afforded the same rights as other workers.  See the links section for more detailed information.</p>

<h3>Understanding your pay</h3>

<p>Dependent on your employment status, you may be entitled to earn the National Minimum Wage or Living Wage (if 25 years old and above). </p>

<p>Most organisations pay monthly and in arrears. Be aware that if you have missed the cut-off date for new starter information to be processed, it could be 6 weeks or more before you receive your first pay. </p>

<p>To be paid, you will be required to provide a National Insurance (NI) number. See the links section to apply for, or find your NI number. You may be required to bring along your NI card, previous pay slip, letter from HMRC, P45 or P60 documents as proof during your interview or on your first day of work. </p>

<h3>Working hours</h3>

<p>Do not assume that the working hours will be the classic 9-5. Some workplaces start and finish either earlier or later, and have different lengths of lunch break.  Some may even work flexi time where as long as you do the hours and the work, it does not matter when you start or finish.  </p>

<p>Confirm these expectations with your employer before you start or during your first week, remembering your employment rights.  Some organisations may ask you to start later on the first day, allowing them the time to prepare for your arrival.  Do not let this confuse you as this is unlikely to be the regular start time.
</p>

<h3>Holiday & Rest Breaks entitlement during work experience</h3>

<p>Think whether it is appropriate to take holiday during your work experience.  Consider the duration of the holiday against the length of the experience, the workload and deadlines that you have committed to. Discuss with your supervisor/ manager in advance, if you have any pre-existing holiday or commitment e.g. graduation day, that will require time-off. </p>

<p>If your salary is inclusive of holiday pay, your leave (if granted), is unlikely to be paid. However, if your salary excludes holiday pay, it is likely that you will be accumulating holidays as you work through your experience.  Workers over 18 years old are also entitled to rest breaks at work. </p>

<h3>Discrimination: Your Rights</h3>

<p>The law protects you against discrimination at work under the Equality Act 2010. It is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>being or becoming a transsexual person</li>
<li>being married or in a civil partnership</li>
<li>being pregnant or on maternity leave</li>
<li>disability</li>
<li>race including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin</li>
<li>religion, belief or lack of religion/belief</li>
<li>sex</li>
<li>sexual orientation</li>
</ul>
