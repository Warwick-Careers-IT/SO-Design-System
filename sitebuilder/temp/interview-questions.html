  <h1>Using work experience for career planning</h1>


<p>Whatever the duration of your work experience, you will have gained some learning, knowledge and skills.  It is important to capture the skills and strengths that you have gained or improved, as evidence of your employability. </p>

<p>Think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>What skills have you improved? What are the situations which have enabled you to make this progress?  Would you like to develop them further?  What are your action plans for doing so?</li>

<li>What skills gap do you still have and would like to improve?  Are they ones that you would personally like to develop or are required for the work that you would like to pursue? </li>

<li>Take note of all your achievements and challenges that you have overcome.</li>

<li>How could the experience have been different, more appropriate for what I want? </li>

<li>Has the experience influenced my career path or plan? What should I work on next time?</li>

</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="info-notice">
  <p>If you have not recorded them, take the time now to capture the experience – perhaps consider using <a href="https://myportfolio.warwick.ac.uk/">MyPortfolio</a>. The records will serve as the database of evidence when asked to prove your suitability for a role that you are applying to or being interviewed for.</p>
</div>

<h2>Update your CV & LinkedIn</h2>

<p>Your work experience has earned a new CV entry that will enhance your employability – time to update your CV & LinkedIn profile!</p>
