# Prototyping environment Node/Nunjucks/SASS/LiveReload

## Introduction

> This codebase allows you to quickly get a local node server running with the added goodness of : nunjucks templating, Express, SASS compiling, LiveReload all elegantly handled with Gulp.

> This prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on warwick.ac.uk. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

## Requirements


You'll usually need admin access to your machine to install the software. If you do not have admin access, ask your IT team to install the software for you.


You'll need:

Node.js 8.x.x and NPM
Atom (or equivalent text editor)
Command line tools (Mac)
Git bash (Windows)

2. Navigated to this directory from Terminal
3. npm install - this will install all the Node modules required
