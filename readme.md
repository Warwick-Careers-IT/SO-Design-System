# Prototyping environment Node/Nunjucks/SASS/LiveReload

## Introduction

> This prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on warwick.ac.uk. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

> This codebase allows you to quickly get a local node server running using nunjucks templating, Express, SASS compiling and LiveReload. This dramtically speed up development time during the prototyping/development phase. It includes the latest warwick ID7 design as nunjucks templates.

> The codebase includes build scripts for things like SASS to CSS and static site generation.

  gulp build

Will deploy the site in the dist directory for use as a demo you can share with others.

Pushing changes back to the remote git repository will deploy these static build files to the following address:

> The docs folder contains a design system and guidance how to use the various typographical and design elements in Student Careers and Skill frontend.
